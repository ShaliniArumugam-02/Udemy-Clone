ðŸŽ“ Udemy Clone â€“ Responsive Website Using Just HTML & CSS
This is a simple, responsive clone of the Udemy homepage, built using just HTML and basic CSS â€” no frameworks, no JavaScript, just the core building blocks of the web.

I made this project to practice structuring layouts, styling with CSS, and making websites responsive across different screen sizes. It recreates the main parts of Udemy's homepage, including the navbar, hero section, course cards, and footer.

âœ¨ Whatâ€™s Inside
Clean and organized HTML structure

CSS-only styling â€” no Bootstrap, no Tailwind

Fully responsive design (works on mobile, tablet, and desktop)

Sticky navigation bar with a basic layout

Course grid section styled to look like Udemyâ€™s course listings

Footer with links and site info

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This
I wanted to improve my front-end skills by building something real without relying on frameworks. This project helped me learn how to:

Use Flexbox and Grid for layout

Write mobile-first CSS

Keep code clean and well-structured
